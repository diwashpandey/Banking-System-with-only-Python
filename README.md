# full banking system with database with only python


This bank's system is fully operational and includes a managed database.
This allows for the structured storing of account data.
Every action that a person takes is saved by this in the history.

All of the code for this system is written in only Python.
The database has not made use of any external modules or libraries.
I have only used the OS module and the file handling system for the database.

<h2>How can I open and run this file?</h2>
- Launch CMD in the dictionary where you've saved this file.<br>
- run banking_system.py using CMD.

<h2>Enjoy!!</h2>
